        This section has a CSS class "<code>informative</code>", so it is
        listed in the TOC. ReSpec will list this reference as non-normative
        since this is an informative section [[HTML]].

      <h2>
        <dfn>Foo</dfn> structure
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a>Foo</a> structure is nice. Lets you do stuff. You SHALL use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ReSpec will list this reference as normative, like [[AV1]]. You SHOULD use references.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an example of a non-normative reference in a normative section
